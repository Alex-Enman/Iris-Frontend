## Purpose
Defines how Cursor agents should write `.md` files for human readers.  
Files must be concise, logically structured, visually clear, and ≤ 300 lines.

## Core Principles
1. **Clarity:** Use natural language, but remain concise and professional.  
2. **Structure:** Organise content with logical headings (`#`, `##`, `###`).  
3. **Readability:** Break text into short paragraphs or bullet points.  
4. **Consistency:** Use consistent tone, tense, and formatting across all documentation.  
5. **Visual Simplicity:** Avoid clutter — whitespace improves readability.  
6. **Length Limit:** ≤ 300 lines per file.
